## Self Hosting 🐳

### One-click Deployments

The easiest way to deploy Kan is through Railway. We've partnered with Railway to maintain an official template that supports the development of the project.

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can self-host Kan with Docker Compose. This will set up everything for you including your postgres database and automatically run migrations.

1. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-) section below)

2. Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file or create your own with the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  migrate:
    image: ghcr.io/kanbn/kan-migrate:latest
    container_name: kan-migrate
    networks:
      - kan-network
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_URL=${POSTGRES_URL}
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: "no"

  web:
    image: ghcr.io/kanbn/kan:latest
    container_name: kan-web
    ports:
      - "${WEB_PORT:-3000}:3000"
    networks:
      - kan-network
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}
      - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=${BETTER_AUTH_SECRET}
      - POSTGRES_URL=${POSTGRES_URL}
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true
    depends_on:
      migrate:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    restart: unless-stopped

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: kan-db
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=kan_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=kan
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - kan_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U kan -d kan_db"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - kan-network

networks:
  kan-network:

volumes:
  kan_postgres_data:
```

3. Start the containers in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The `migrate` service will automatically run database migrations before the web service starts. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in `WEB_PORT`).

**Managing containers:**

- To stop the containers: `docker compose down`
- To view logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- To view logs for a specific service: `docker compose logs -f web` or `docker compose logs -f migrate`
- To restart the containers: `docker compose restart`
- To rebuild after code changes: `docker compose up -d --build`

For the complete Docker Compose configuration with all optional features, see [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) in the repository.

## Local Development 🧑‍💻

1. Clone the repository (or fork)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kanbn/kan.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
4. Migrate database

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

5. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Google Workspace 🗓️

**Google Chat.** Workspace admins can post card updates to Chat spaces from **Settings → Google Chat**. In the Chat space, open **Apps & integrations → Webhooks → Add webhook**, copy the URL and paste it into Kan. Each space can follow every board or one board, and you choose which events it gets (new cards, moves, comments, completed cards, due date reminders and more). Messages about the same card are threaded together. Your Google Workspace admin must allow incoming webhooks in Chat.

**Google Calendar and Tasks.** With `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` set, everyone gets **Connect Google** under **Settings → Account**. Kan then keeps a "Kan" calendar (an event at each due time, carrying the card's reminder) and a "Kan" task list in their own Google account, for the cards they're a member of. Kan can only see the calendar and task list it creates. Google Tasks stores dates only, so tasks show the due day without a time.

To set it up in Google Cloud:

1. Enable the **Google Calendar API** and the **Google Tasks API**.
2. On the OAuth consent screen, choose **Internal** (Google Workspace) and add the scopes `.../auth/calendar.app.created` and `.../auth/tasks`.
3. On the OAuth client, add `{NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/api/integrations/google/callback` as an authorised redirect URI.

**Google Drive.** With `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY` also set, cards get a **Google Drive** button. It opens Google's file picker, and the files someone picks are linked to the card with their name and icon. The first time, Kan asks for access to Drive with the `drive.file` scope, which only covers the files a person picks in Kan, never the rest of their Drive. Files stay in Drive: Kan stores only the link, so who can open a file is still decided by its sharing settings in Drive.

To turn it on, in the same Google Cloud project:

1. Enable the **Google Picker API** and the **Google Drive API**.
2. Add the scope `.../auth/drive.file` to the OAuth consent screen.
3. Create an **API key**, restrict it to the Google Picker API, and under website restrictions add your Kan URL (for example `https://kan.example.com/*`). Set it as `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY`.

Google calls run in the background through the same scheduler as due date reminders, and retry if Google is briefly unavailable.

## MCP Server (AI Control) 🤖

Kan ships with a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that lets any MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others) read and control your Kan instance using natural language.

Run it with `npx`, no clone or global install required:

```bash
npx -y @kan/mcp
```

Configure it with two environment variables: `KAN_BASE_URL` (your Kan instance) and `KAN_API_TOKEN` (from **Settings → API Keys**). Then point your client's MCP config at the `npx -y @kan/mcp` command.

See the [MCP Server docs](https://docs.kan.bn/integrations/mcp-server) for per-client config (Claude Desktop, Codex, and others), example prompts, the full tool reference, and troubleshooting.
